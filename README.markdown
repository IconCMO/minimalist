Minimalist
==========

Minimalist is a near clone of CKEditor's Office2003 skin. I've desaturated the blues into grays, removed the misleading dragger dots from the toolbars, fixed a problem I was having with the font and size dropdown boxes, and rounded the dialog close button. Small changes, but it was enough to make the theme integrate far more successfully into our [application](http://iconcmo.com).
